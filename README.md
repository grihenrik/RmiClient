# RmiClient
Java RMI client

Take a look at the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) technology and a MySQL connection using JDBC technology on the Java platform. 
RMI is a remote procedure call technology, where it is used for java object serialization in the transferring of data.

Create an example application where you have a RMI server and a RMI console client in the same local computer. The server inserts, gets, updates and deletes data in the MySQL table. Records are transferred using java objects. All methods should have at least one object as a calling parameter and, if the methods return a parameter, the return parameter is of the same class object or an array of objects as the calling parameter.

Use Netbeans as an IDE. Load MySQL java connector into your project. MySQL table can be in niisku-server and then you must use OpenVPN when your computer is outside of our laboratory network.

Return both projects (server and client) in one zipped file which name is '<yor username>.zip'.
